      <description>CDS’s mission is to change government to serve people better.
The Policy team supports this mission by helping product teams, communities, and leadership at CDS navigate government processes, overcome barriers, and work as effectively as possible.
Who we are  John Millons (head of policy) John Kenney Lucas Cherkewski Michael Karlin Sam Burton Sarah Hobson Sean Boots  What we do Our work tends to cover three main areas:
 CDS delivery: Serving on CDS product teams to help navigate government rules, processes or overcome barriers Scaling delivery: Sharing what works and what doesn’t based on delivery experience, to inform policy-making and enable others to work more effectively towards digital service delivery.</description>
