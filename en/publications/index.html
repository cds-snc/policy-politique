                <small><b>Summary:</b> Software subscription services are online tools, paid for on a monthly or annual basis.

                <small><b>Summary:</b> The federal government’s struggles with technology as a core competency, particularly as it underpins service delivery, are no secret. The main impediments to changing this reality are not technological. They are our reluctance and inability to revisit service models, processes, rules, sunk costs, and organizational structures largely established in an analog, slower-moving era.</small>

                <small><b>Summary:</b> Hedging is a way of introducing optionality to large, in-flight IT projects: instead of only betting big on a single approach, a small slice of the project funding is dedicated to trying another method. This hedge amount is small compared to the overall project cost, and decreases the risk of failure.</small>

We use a well-established play to help drive this mission: bringing together multidisciplinary talent into teams that tackle a service challenge together. Our product teams include designers, researchers, developers and product managers, but we’ve also embedded policy and communications people into those teams.</small>
