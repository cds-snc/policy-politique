title: "Bringing together policy and digital delivery"
description: "Here at the Canadian Digital Service, we’ve been lucky to have great role models to learn from, in the U.K., the U.S., Italy, Australia, Ontario, and many other places, as we work with our partners to improve digital services for Canadians. We use a well-established play to help drive this mission: bringing together multidisciplinary talent into teams that tackle a service challenge together. Our product teams include designers, researchers, developers and product managers, but we’ve also embedded policy and communications people into those teams."
